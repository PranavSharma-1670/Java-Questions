## üìÅ Module 2

### üì¶ Section 1: Defining, Implementing, and Importing Packages

1. Create a Java package `utilities` that contains a class `MathUtils` with a method `add(int a, int b)` to return the sum of two numbers. Demonstrate the use of this package in another class.
2. Define a package `shapes` containing an interface `Shape` with methods `double area()` and `double perimeter()`. Implement the interface in classes `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
