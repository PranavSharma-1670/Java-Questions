## üìÅ Module 3

### ‚öôÔ∏è Lab_Work_Mod_3_Set2 ‚Äî Thread Synchronization and Concurrency

1. Synchronized Method: Create a Java program where two threads try to update the same bank account balance. Use synchronization to ensure the balance is updated correctly and avoid race conditions.
2. Synchronized Block: Modify the above program (bank account example) to use a synchronized block instead of a synchronized method.
3. Thread Deadlock: Write a program that simulates a deadlock condition. Create two threads that attempt to lock two different resources and cause a deadlock.
4. Using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(): Implement a producer-consumer scenario where one thread (producer) produces data and another thread (consumer) consumes it. Use the wait() and notify() methods for synchronization.
5. Stopping a Thread: Write a program that safely stops a thread using a flag. The thread should print numbers from 1 to 100, and the program should be able to stop the thread by setting the flag to false.

2. Create a thread by implementing the Runnable interface that takes a string "MULTITHREADING" and prints its characters in reverse order one by one.
3. Thread Sleep Method: Create a program that creates two threads. The first thread should print "Thread 1" every 1 second, and the second thread should print "Thread 2" every 2 seconds.
4. Countdown Timer: One thread prints a countdown from 10 to 1 (1-second delay), while another thread simultaneously prints "Tick..." every half a second.
5. Thread Naming and Priority: Create three threads ‚Äî "Worker-1", "Worker-2", and "Worker-3". Assign different priorities and print their execution order.

1. Use the ReentrantLock class to create a safe counter incremented by multiple threads. Compare results with a non-locked version.
2. Create two threads acquiring two locks (lock1 and lock2) in opposite order to cause a deadlock. Then fix it using tryLock() with a timeout.

### üìÇ I/O Streams ‚Äî Byte and Character Streams

1. Byte Stream: Read a file using FileInputStream and print its contents.
